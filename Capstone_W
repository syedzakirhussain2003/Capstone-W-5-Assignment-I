This is very hectic and I will be exploring different types of environment, of which i don\u2019t have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommend it to the people. Food can also attract people around the world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addressed, such as :\n\n1.\tHow many types of foods are available in the restaurant ? \n2.\twhich is the most nearest to me with good rating ?\n3.\tHow many \"similar\" restaurants are available nearby me ?\n4.\tDo the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what specialty do that have ?\n\nTo address such question, I have  decided to this project to answer to above questions and also try to build a system which can help people recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\n\nExpectations from this recommendation  system is to get answer for the questions, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing recommendations. It is sighted to show :\n\n1.\tWhat types of restaurants are present in a particular area  of one the largest cities of India (In Particular Mumbai)?\n2.\twhere are the similar restaurant present based on a preference to particular food ?\n3.\tHow do different restaurants rank with respect to my preferences ?\n\n"

People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handled by our recommendation system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places."

On the other hand, Computers are good at remembering things, and with Machine learning to its peak, it high time technology will by our personal guidance and help us personally based on our likes and dislikes. So people would care about this project as their personal assistance and success rate would certainly increase with time."
